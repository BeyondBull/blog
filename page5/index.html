        What Every Data Scientist Needs to Know about SQL
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>One of the most important tools required to be a successful data
scientist is relational databases like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>.  The majority of data
stored by businesses is in these relational databases. And in
addition, they are exceptionally good at storing complicated business
data sets as well as allowing for efficient information retrieval.
So having a strong understanding of relational databases is essential
to being an effective data scientist.</p>

<p>In this series of posts, I will provide a broad overview of the key
topics required to successfully work with databases to do effective
data science. My hope is to take a breath-first search approach to
teaching by introducing the most important topics first.  Whenever
possible, I will attempt to avoid theory in favor of practicality
with the goal of getting you up to speed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In these posts, I will focus on the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
database because it is popular, free, open source, and easy to get started
with. But the concepts and most of the commands are easily transferable
to other databases.</p>

<p>The posts in this series are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/database-normalization">Design a Better Database With Database Normalization</a></strong></p>

    <p>In this post, we will go over the design decisions behind
databases, how they are different from other programming languages
and data formats, and how to lay out our data so that it will
fit into a SQL database.  By way of a simple example, we will
go over the basics of database normalization, the best-practice
for correctly storing complex data in a database.  Despite being
a bit abstract and theoretical, these topics are absolutely
essential to understanding how databases work and why they are
so good at what they do. So this is a must read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/install-mysql">How to Install MySQL On Your Local Machine</a></strong></p>

    <p>In this post, we will describe how to install MySQL on our local
machine. This will allow you to test out SQL by running SQL
queries against a test database. By the end of this post,
you will have MySQL running on your local machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/create-tables-sql">How to Create Tables and Insert Data into SQL Databases</a></strong></p>

    <p>In this post, we will go over the SQL commands required to create
tables in MySQL and insert data into them.  I will go over the
specific commands required to create the example database from
the <a href="/database-normalization">first post</a> 
of the series. By the end of this post, you will have an
example database on you computer to run SQL queries against.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/filters-joins-aggregations">“Filters, Joins, Aggregations, and All That: A Guide to Querying in SQL”</a></strong></p>

    <p>In this post, we will go over the basics of querying data from
a database. Using the example from above, I will work through
successively harder queries show how the simple operations can
be combined write complicated queries.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL databases are designed to deal with <code>NULL</code> values
in a sensible way. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/working-with-null.html">Here</a>
is some documentation about the way MySQL handles <code>NULL</code> values.</li>
  <li>Views in
SQL act as temporary tables able to simplify queries 
as well as abstract a user from the underlying table implementations. 
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-view.html">Here</a> 
is some documenation about how they are handled by MySQL.</li>
  <li>Beyond <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, there are several
high-performance parallel databases designed to deal with large data sets.
Two popular ones are <a href="http://www.teradata.com/">Terradata</a> and
<a href="http://www.vertica.com/">HP Vertica</a>.</li>
  <li>For very large data sets, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">hadoop</a>,
the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html">Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</a>,
and <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html">MapReduce</a> 
are typically used to store and analyze these large data sets. 
<a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Apache Hive</a> is an implementation of
SQL on top of MapReduce which brings the power of SQL to hadoop.
<a href="https://pig.apache.org/">Apache Pig</a> and <a href="https://github.com/twitter/scalding">Scalding</a>
are similar competitors.</li>
  <li>Bill Howe’s coursera class 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci">Introduction to Data Science</a>
has a good discussion of SQL query optimizers in his lectures on
“<a href="https://class.coursera.org/datasci-001/lecture/preview">Relational Databases, Relational Algebra</a>”.</li>
