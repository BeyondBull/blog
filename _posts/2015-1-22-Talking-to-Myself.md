My job requires me to spend a large portion of my week driving around, it's common for me to spend anywhere for 1-6 hours a day in my car.  I could only listen to the same chart topping songs repeated so much.  Even with a large iTunes collection l found that I craved intelligent conversation.  I began listening to sport talk radio.  I admit it doesn't quite fit the intelligent part of my craving.  It dose however have a familiarity.  I was listening to the same conversations that I would have with friends or coworkers.  It was like sitting at a bar listening to two guys talk about last nights game I couldn't hold back they'd say something and before I knew it I'm yelling at my radio "Why'd we trade for another pitcher it's our offense that's struggling, we need a bat". 


I will frequently need to rewind the podcast I'm listening to because I've spent the last 20 minute having a debate in my head about a particular topic or comment.  

Now it's time I throw those thoughts out into the vast internet void.
