    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <p>My job requires me to spend a large portion of my week driving around, it’s common for me to spend anywhere for 1-6 hours a day in my car.  I could only listen to the same chart topping songs repeated so much.  Even with a large iTunes collection l found that I craved intelligent conversation.  I began listening to sport talk radio.  I admit it doesn’t quite fit the intelligent part of my craving.  It dose however have a familiarity.  I was listening to the same conversations that I would have with friends or coworkers.  It was like sitting at a bar listening to two guys talk about last nights game I couldn’t hold back they’d say something and before I knew it I’m yelling at my radio “Why’d we trade for another pitcher it’s our offense that’s struggling, we need a bat”. </p>

<p>I will frequently need to rewind the podcast I’m listening to because I’ve spent the last 20 minute having a debate in my head about a particular topic or comment.  </p>

<p>Now it’s time I throw those thoughts out into the vast internet void.

    <p><em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel’s supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll’s loyal butler.</p>

<hr />

<p>Poole is the butler for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator. It’s designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.</p>

<p>There are currently two themes built on Poole:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Learn more and contribute on <a href="https://github.com/poole">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whats-included">What’s included</h3>

<p>Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it, includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404.html">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
  <li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
  <li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code>rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
  <li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
  <li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional features are available in individual themes.</p>

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser support</h3>

<p>Poole and it’s themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>Poole is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.</p>
